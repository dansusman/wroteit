# wroteit - A Simplified, Bootleg Reddit.

wroteit is a full-stack clone of Reddit.com, built with TypeScript, React, Node.JS, GraphQL, PostgreSQL, TypeORM, URQL, and Next.JS. The UI was designed using Chakra UI and Figma.

This clone is <strong>not</strong> intended to have all the functionality of the real Reddit, but it includes the following:

1. Create a Post
2. Edit a Post
3. Delete a Post
4. Upvote/Downvote a Post
5. View a Post's full description
6. Create a New User
7. Log in as an Existing User
8. Forgot Password Emailing **Currently only working in development. To enable forgot password feature, a subscription to an Email Service would be required. This may be added in the future.**

Check out the code in this repository, or view the website at https://wroteit.dansusman.dev.

### Disclaimer

The website is not currently mobile responsive, and is most attractive on a computer screen. This project's focus is more heavily on the backend design than the frontend, but website responsivity may be implemented in the future.
