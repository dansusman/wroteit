# wroteit - A Simplified, Bootleg Reddit.

wroteit is a full-stack clone of Reddit.com, built with TypeScript, React, Node.JS, GraphQL, PostgreSQL, TypeORM, URQL, and Next.JS.

1. Create a Post
2. Edit a Post
3. Delete a Post
4. Upvote/Downvote a Post
5. View a Post's full description
6. Create a New User
7. Log in as an Existing User
